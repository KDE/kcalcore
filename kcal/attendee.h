  @brief
  Represents information related to an attendee of an Calendar Incidence,
  typically a meeting or task (to-do).

  Attendees are people with a name and (optional) email address who are
  invited to participate in some way in a meeting or task.  This class
  also tracks that status of the invitation: accepted; tentatively accepted;
  declined; delegated to another person; in-progress; completed.

  Attendees may optionally be asked to @acronym RSVP ("Respond Please") to
  the invitation.

  Note that each attendee be can optionally associated with a @acronym UID
  (unique identifier) derived from a Calendar Incidence, Email Message,
  or any other thing you want.

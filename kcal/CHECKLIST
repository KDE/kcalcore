Qt4Port -> no deprecated warnings; thiago says do NO replace const iterator
          loops with 'foreach()'

TODO: revert foreach() loops?
TODO: change "todo" to "to-do" in comments
TODO: put KDE_VERSION stuff into kcal.h and remove kde_version.h??

thiago: rule of thumb: ConstIterators, constBegin, constEnd, all of the time
if it doesn't compile (i.e., you're doing a non-const operation), then use
the non-const version
dfaure: better than ConstIterator, const_iterator. This one will always remain
since it's the STL name for it ;)
dfaure: foreach is convenient when writing throwable code, unit tests,
or code where performance doesn't matter, but better leave existing
iterator-using code unchanged.

Libraries we want to move into the kdepimlibs module, and what needs to be done
to make it happen.

Minimum requirements for moving a library here:
 1. LGPL, BSD, or X11 license
 2. All dependencies must also meet minimum requirements

BIC stuff (like d-pointers) and complete APIDOX may be completed after the move.

Please drop the "lib" prefix part of the source directory name
(i.e. libfoo -> foo): headers will be installed into include/foo,
but the library name will still be libfoo.so.

Each library foo will have its own foo_export.h that includes the
all visibility macros  (no separate foo_export_win.h)

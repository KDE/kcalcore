  @brief
  A class that can be used for access to Wordpress blogs. This is needed because of an ugly
  DateTime bug in Wordpress. Hopefully the bug will be fixed in the near feature. This class 
  reimplements createPosting and modifyPosting from scratch to send the DateTime in a format 
  like yyyyMMddThh:mm:ss which is not ISO conform. The date is not extended, where the time is extended.
  The rest of the code is used from MovableType, as Wordpress implements MovableType. You should not use this
  code on non-Wordpress blogs.
  @code
  Blog* myblog = new WordpressBuggy("http://example.com/xmlrpc/gateway.php");
  myblog->setUsername( "some_user_id" );
  myblog->setPassword( "YoURFunnyPAsSwoRD" );
  KBlog::BlogPost *post = new BlogPosting();
  post->setTitle( "This is the title." );
  post->setContent( "Here is some the content..." );
  myblog->createPosting( posting );

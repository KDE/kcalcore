 * @mainpage kxmlrpcclient - an XML-RPC client library for KDE.
 *
 * @section purpose Purpose
 *
 * kxmlrpclient provides client-side support for the XML-RPC protocol.
 *
 * @section desc Description
 *
 * This library contains simple XML-RPC Client support. It is used mainly
 * by the egroupware module of kdepim, but is a complete client and is
 * quite easy to use. Only one interface is exposed to the world,
 * kxmlrpcclient/client.h and of that interface, you only need to
 * use 3 methods: setUrl, setUserAgent and call.
 *
 * A small note on authentication. If you will be accessing an XML-RPC server
 * which uses HTTP-AUTH, simply set the user and pass in the KURL. Digest
 * authentication is more complicated and requires the use of three utility
 * methods: enableDigestAuth, disableDigestAuth and digestAuth.

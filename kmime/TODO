Things we still need to work on in the library
==============================================

+ Finish apidox
 : the code generation macros in kmime_headers.h are a problem for doxygen

+ D-pointers

+ Use KDateTime::toString() as much as possible in DateFormatter class.
  If KDateTime ever supports fancy format, we should be able to replace
  DateFormatter completely with KDateTime::toString().

+ do we still need our own KAutoDeleteHash in Qt4/KDE4?

+ Lots of methods we might want to de-inline

+ Remove extra namespaces. probably only KMime namespace needed.

+ There are also methods, eg. in kmime_header_parsing.h, which don't need to
  be part of the public API

+ More tests and unit-tests

This is a collection of changes which should eventually be done:

- Emit resourceClosed(Resource*) signal in Resource::close(). For othogonality
we should probably also emit resourceOpened(), resourceLoaded(), resourceSaved()
signals.
- Add function to Resource to return the translated label of the type
- Find better solution than passing the family name as string to the Manager
  constructor.

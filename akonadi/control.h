/**
 * @short Provides methods to control the Akonadi server process.
 *
 * This class provides high-level methods to control the Akonadi
 * server. These methods are synchronously (ie. use a sub-eventloop)
 * and can show dialogs. For more low-level methods see
 * Akonadi::ServerManager.
 *
 * While the Akonadi server normally is started by the KDE session
 * manager, it is not guaranteed that your application is running
 * inside a KDE session. Therefore it is recommended to execute
 * Akonadi::Control::start() during startup to ensure the Akonadi
 * server is running.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * if ( !Akonadi::Control::start() ) {
 *   qDebug() << "Unable to start Akonadi server, exit application";
 *   return 1;
 * } else {
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * @endcode

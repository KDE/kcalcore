/**
 * @short Manages generic actions for collection and item views.
 *
 * Manages generic Akonadi actions common for all types. This covers
 * creating of the actions with appropriate labels, icons, shortcuts
 * etc., updating the action state depending on the current selection
 * as well as default implementations for the actual operations.
 *
 * If the default implementation is not appropriate for your application
 * you can still use the state tracking by disconnecting the triggered()
 * signal and re-connecting it to your implementation. The actual KAction
 * objects can be retrieved by calling createAction() or action() for that.
 *
 * If the default look and feel (labels, icons, shortcuts) of the actions
 * is not appropriate for your application, you can access them as noted
 * above and customize them to your needs. Additionally, you can set a
 * KLocalizedString which should be used as a action label with correct
 * plural handling for actions operating on multiple objects with
 * setActionText().
 *
 * Finally, if you have special needs for the action states, connect to
 * the actionStateUpdated() signal and adjust the state accordingly.
 *
 * The following actions are provided (KAction name in parenthesis):
 * - Creation of a new collection (@c akonadi_collection_create)
 * - Copying of selected collections (@c akonadi_collection_copy)
 * - Deletion of selected collections (@c akonadi_collection_delete)
 * - Synchronization of selected collections (@c akonadi_collection_sync)
 * - Showing the collection properties dialog for the current collection (@c akonadi_collection_properties)
 * - Copying of selected items (@c akonadi_itemcopy)
 * - Pasting collections, items or raw data (@c akonadi_paste)
 * - Deleting of selected items (@c akonadi_item_delete)
 * - Managing local subscriptions (@c akonadi_manage_local_subscriptions)
 *
 * The following example shows how to use standard actions in your application:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * Akonadi::StandardActionManager *actMgr = new Akonadi::StandardActionManager( actionCollection(), this );
 * actMgr->setCollectionSelectionModel( collectionView->collectionSelectionModel() );
 * actMgr->createAllActions();
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * Additionally you have to add the actions to the KXMLGUI file of your application,
 * using the names listed above.
 *
 * If you only need a subset of the actions provided, you can call createAction()
 * instead of createAllActions() for the action types you want.
 *
 * @todo collection deleting and sync do not support multi-selection yet
 *

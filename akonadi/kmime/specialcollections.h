/**
  @short Interface to special collections such as inbox, outbox etc.

  This class is the central interface to the local mail folders. These folders
  can either be in the default resource (stored in ~/.local/share/local-mail)
  or in any number of custom resources. Special collections of the following types
  are supported: inbox, outbox, sent-mail, trash, drafts, templates and spam.

  To check whether a special collection is available, simply use the hasCollection() and
  hasDefaultCollection() methods. Available special collections are accessible through
  the collection() and defaultCollection() methods.

  To create a special collection, use a SpecialCollectionsRequestJob.
  This will create the special collections you request and automatically
  register them with SpecialCollections, so that it now knows they are available.

  This class monitors all special collections known to it, and removes it
  from the known list if they are deleted. Note that this class does not
  automatically rebuild the collections that disappeared.

  The defaultCollectionsChanged() and collectionsChanged() signals are emitted when
  the special collections for a resource change (i.e. some became available or some
  become unavailable).

  @code
  if( SpecialCollections::self()->hasDefaultCollection( SpecialCollections::Outbox ) ) {
    const Collection col = SpecialCollections::self()->defaultCollection( SpecialCollections::Outbox );
    // ...
  } else {
    // ... use SpecialCollectionsRequestJob to request the collection...
  }
  @endcode

  Creates and monitors the Outbox and Sent-Mail collections for the mail

  The first time it is used, or when you call fetch(), this class checks for
  the following:
  * a maildir resource with name 'Local Mail Folders'
  * 'outbox' and 'sent-mail' collections under that resource
  If they do not exist, this class creates them, and then emits foldersReady().

  Do not store the collections returned by outbox() and sentMail().  They can
  become invalid if e.g. the user deletes them and LocalFolders creates them
  again, so you should always use LocalFolders::outbox() instead of storing
  its return value.

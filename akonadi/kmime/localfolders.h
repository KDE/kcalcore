/**
  @short Interface to local folders such as inbox, outbox etc.

  TODO: update this and method API docs...

  This class provides access to the following default (and undeletable) local
  folders: inbox, outbox, sent-mail, trash, drafts, and templates; as well as
  the root local folder containing them.  The user may create custom
  subfolders in the root local folder, or in any of the default local folders.

  By default, these folders are stored in a maildir in
  $HOME/.local/share/mail.

  This class also monitors the local folders and the maildir resource hosting
  them, and re-creates them when necessary (for example, if the user
  accidentally removed the maildir resource).  For this reason, you must make
  sure the local folders are ready before calling any of the accessor
  functions.  It is also recommended that you always use this class to access
  the local folders, instead of, for example, storing the result of
  LocalFolders::self()->outbox() locally.

  @code
  connect( LocalFolders::self(), SIGNAL(foldersReady()),
      this, SLOT(riseAndShine()) );
  LocalFolders::self()->fetch();
  @endcode
